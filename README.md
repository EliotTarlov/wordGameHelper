This is a little program I wrote to help me come up with words I couldn't conjure for wordle! Its going to ask you for three things.
First it will ask for  the letters you know the places of. It wants this as a string (of any length) of all lower case letters and asterisks (*) wherever you don't know the location of letters (for example a string might look like a*bd* or *ddsd). I recommend no more than 3 asterisks. The remaining options are optional! So feel free to ignore them if you prefer (just enter nothing).
The other two are (in order) letters you know are good but don't know the location of and letters you know are bad. Both of these just want letters so really any format will do but a single word of just letters (like apftg) is best. Note that the dictionaries used are intentionally extremely loose! Don't just trust this (or any program) blindly!
